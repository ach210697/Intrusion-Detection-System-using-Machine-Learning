# Threat Detection System using AI

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered threat detection system using machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional rule-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), this system leverages advanced algorithms to provide real-time threat alerts, adaptive security, and improved accuracy. It is designed to be scalable and customizable to address evolving cyber threats.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes ML and deep learning models for threat detection, offering better accuracy compared to traditional rule-based systems.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Provides real-time threat alerts with adaptive security measures.
- **Scalable and Customizable**: Designed to adapt to new and evolving cyber threats.
- **Optimized Models**: Focus on reducing false positives and improving detection accuracy.

## Next Steps
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect and preprocess datasets such as NSL-KDD and CICIDS 2017.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train models using Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks for threat detection.
3. **Backend and Frontend Development**:
   - Develop a backend in Python for processing and real-time alerts.
   - Create a frontend dashboard for visualizing threats and alerts.
4. **Model Optimization**:
   - Optimize models to reduce false positives and enhance accuracy.
